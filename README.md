# Minimal [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/) bootstrap project

Very minimalist skeleton, no external python libraries required than 'bottle'

## Why?
If you want a starting-point for your own experiments in making websites in Python, this isn't the worst place that you could start.  

## Easy Setup

* `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install -r requirements.txt -t lib/`to install these dependencies in this project's lib/ directory. 
* Edit the view code in [app.py](app.py)
* Edit the page template in [views/main.tpl](views/main.tpl)

## Running

* run _app.py_ (i.e. `python app.py)
* Browse to localhost:8080
